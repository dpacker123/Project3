# Project3
I hired a tutor to help on this project. I was nto able to come up with all of this myself. 
I want to be transparent and open about this. 
I am not a CS major and I took python 2 years ago. I am so lost in the class that the only way i was bale to do was to 
have an outside tutor help me.
